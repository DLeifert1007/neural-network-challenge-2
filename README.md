# neural-network-challenge-2

I have been tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so I will also predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.


Part 1: Preprocessing

I coded out a section to show what work I was doing that continued to be unsucessful. Instaed I reached out to Xpert learner for help and the code that worked is from the help. This is in the OneHotEncoder for the 'Education' column. 

Part 2: Create, Compile, and Train the Model
